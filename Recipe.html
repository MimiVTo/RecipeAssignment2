        <li>A Pinch of Salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="color:brown; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Steps to Prepare and Make Cake</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C)</li>
        <li>Grease two 9-inch cake pans, line with parchment paper rounds, then grease the parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Make the cake: Whisk the flour, baking soda, cocoa powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Using a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on medium-high speed until combined, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. Add the oil, egg yolks, vanilla extract, and vinegar and beat on high for 2 minutes. (Set the egg whites aside.)</li>
        <li>Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a silicone spatula as needed.</li>
        <li>With the mixer on low speed, add the dry ingredients in 2-3 additions alternating with the buttermilk. Beat in your desired amount of food coloring just until combined.</li>
        <li>Vigorously whisk or beat the 4 egg whites on high speed until fluffy peaks form for 3 mins.</li>
        <li>Divide batter between cake pans. Bake for 30-32 minutes or until the tops of the cakes spring back when gently touched and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Remove cakes from the oven and cool completely in the pans set on a wire rack. The cakes must be completely cool before frosting and assembling.</li>
        <li>Make the frosting: In a large bowl using a mixer fitted with a whisk or paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and butter together on medium-high speed until smooth, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the confectioners sugar, vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt.</li>
        <li>Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then increase to high speed and beat for 3 minutes until completely combined and creamy.</li>
        <li>Assemble and frost: Using a large serrated knife, slice a thin layer off the tops of the cakes to create a flat surface.</li>
        <li>Evenly cover the top with frosting and repeat process for layers.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate cake for at least 30-60 minutes before slicing. This helps the cake hold its shape when cutting.</li>
        <li>Cover leftover cake tightly and store in the refrigerator for 5 days. Frosted cake or unfrosted cake layers can be frozen up to 2-3 months.</li>
        <li>Thaw overnight in the refrigerator and bring to room temperature before decorating/serving.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
